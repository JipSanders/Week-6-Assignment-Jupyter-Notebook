# # Data Science Tools and Environment

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# Objectives covered in this notebook:
# 
# * Commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists.
# * Simple arithmetic expressions used in Python.
# * Popular data science tools.
# * Popular data science languages.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
#     1. Python
#     2. R Language
#     3. SQL
#     4. C++
#     5. Java

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
#     
#    1. Pandas
#    2. NumPy
#    3. SciPy
#    4. Matplotlib

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluation arithmetic expressions in Python:
# 
# 1. x = y + z
# 2. x = y - z
# 3. x = y * z
# 4. x = y / z

# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply and then add integers:

# In[2]:


(3*4)+5


# This will convert 200 minutes into hours using divide.

# In[3]:


200/60
